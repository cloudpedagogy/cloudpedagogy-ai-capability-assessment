# AI Capability Self-Assessment Tool

A lightweight, static, browser-based AI capability self-assessment tool for reflecting on organisational readiness and maturity across six domains, based on the CloudPedagogy AI Capability Framework.

Designed for education, research, and public-service organisations, this open, framework-led tool supports reflective discussion and capability development rather than auditing, compliance, or benchmarking.

## Overview

The AI Capability Self-Assessment helps individuals and teams explore how well their organisation is positioned to use artificial intelligence responsibly, effectively, and sustainably.

Rather than focusing on specific AI tools or technologies, the assessment examines organisational AI capability across six interdependent domains:

- Awareness  
- Human–AI Co-Agency  
- Applied Practice & Innovation  
- Ethics, Equity & Impact  
- Decision-Making & Governance  
- Reflection, Learning & Renewal  

## Key Characteristics

- Framework-led and non-prescriptive  
- Reflective rather than evaluative  
- Static and private (runs entirely in the browser)  
- Explainable, rule-based interpretation  
- No data storage, transmission, or tracking
